- Next catch bus to Chuzenji Onsen area. Bus stop is just in front of station. I recommend to have bus time table printed paper from tourist center. Catch the bus and get off at Akechidira ropeway. please mind that if you go to akechidira ropeway then do it in outward journey because when coming back from chuzenji onsen to tobu nikko station, bus does not stop at the repoway station.
