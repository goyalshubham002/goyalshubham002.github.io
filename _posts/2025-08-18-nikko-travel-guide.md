## Overview
A realistic, low-stress 2-Day, 3-Night plan covering Haritage area - Toshogu Shrine, Shinkyo Bridge, and Kegon Falls, Okunikko and Kinugawa area. This itinerary uses public trasport.  We purchased Nikko All area pass which covers all major areas including Chuzenji Cruise and some good discounts. 

## Day 1 : Okunikko 
  ## Morning
