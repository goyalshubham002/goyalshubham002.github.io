## Overview
A realistic, low-stress 3-Days, 2-Night plan covering Haritage area - Toshogu Shrine, Shinkyo Bridge, and Kegon Falls, Okunikko and Kinugawa area. This itinerary uses public trasport.  We purchased Nikko All area pass which costed 8000¥ and covers bus and train transport to all major areas including Chuzenji Cruise and some good discounts. 

## Day 1 : Okunikko 
  ## Morning 
- **Travel from Tokyo to Nikko** - Catch Limited Express train run by Tobu at **07:50** Asakusa → Tobu-Nikkō (approx 2h). We caugth Spacia X at 07:50AM from Asakusa to Tobu Nikko. This is most time saving option with little premium. Of course, you can choose to travel by Bus or Regular train. 
- Once arrived at Tobu nikko station, have refreshment & drop your luggage to coin locker inside station. please mind that you need to use coin lockers on the platform itself as coin lockers outside platform can accomodate small baggage only. 
- Next catch bus to Chuzenji Onsen area. Bus stop is just in front of station. I recommend to have bus time table ptinted paper from tourist center. Catch the bus and get off at Akechidira ropeway. please mind that if you go to akechidira ropeway then do it in outward journey because when coming back from chuzenji onsen to tobu nikko station, bus does not stop at the repoway station. 
- Toshogu Shrine complex; leave by 11:30.


## Day 2 : Kinugawa 

## Day 3 : Kinugawa and Some Free time 




## Afternoon
- Shinkyo Bridge short stop.
- Bus to **Kegon Falls**; late lunch nearby.

## Evening
- Return to Tokyo or soak at an onsen before the train back.

> Practical tips: transport cards, lockers, weather window, and backup plans.
