## Overview
A realistic, low-stress 3-Days, 2-Night plan covering Heritage area - Toshogu Shrine, Shinkyo Bridge, and Kegon Falls, Okunikko and Kinugawa area. I travelled with my wife and during our trip we used public transport and covered some off-beat destinations. We purchased Nikko All area pass which costed 8000¥ per person and that covered - round trip from Asakusa to Tobu Nikko, Nikko area buses and trains transport, Chuzenji Sightseeing Cruise, and some discounts at some places. 

## Day 1: Okunikko 
  ## Morning 
- **Travel from Tokyo to Nikko** - Catch Limited Express train run by Tobu at Asakusa Bound for Tobu-Nikkō. All seats are reserved in Limited express so book in advance. We caught Spacia X at **07:50AM** from Asakusa to Tobu Nikko & Arrived at **09:39AM**. This is most time-saving option with little premium. Of course, you can choose to travel by Bus or Regular train. 
- Once arrived at Tobu nikko station, have refreshment & drop your luggage to coin locker inside station. Please remember that for large sized luggage you need to use coin lockers on the platform itself as coin lockers outside platform can accommodate small baggage only. 
- Next catch bus to Chuzenji Onsen area. Bus stop is just in front of station. I recommend having bus time table printed paper from tourist center. Catch the bus and get off at Akechidaira ropeway. Please mind that if you go to Akechidaira ropeway then do it in outward journey because when coming back from Chuzenji onsen to tobu nikko station, bus does not stop at the ropeway station. 
- Enjoy scenic beauty and purchase Round Trip Akechidaira Ropeway Tickets. You will get 100 Yen discount if you show Nikko All area pass. Time to be spent ~40 mins.
  ## Noon 
- Go to bus stop and get bus bound for Chuenzi Onsen and get off at Chuzenji Onsen Station.
- Walk upto Kegaon Falls ~ Short Walk from bus station. Time to be spent ~ 30 mins. 
- Have lunch Nearby 
- Next walk to Chuzenji Sightseeing Cruise. Go to ticket counter and purchase ticket. If you have Nikko All area pass, your ticket is already covered. We took the cruise to cover round trip around Chueznji Stop. Free hop on - hop off at any stop. Time to be spent ~ 1.5 hrs. 
  ## Evening 
- Take Bus bound for Tobu Nikko station and get off at Shinkyo bridge bus stop. Next, we will explore National Heritage Area 
- Walk upto Toshogu Shrine, which is one of most admired in Japan. It enshrines First shogun of Japan. The design is stunning, and it features three wise monkeys learning too - depicting philosophy - see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil. [Mahatma Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi) also adopted this as moral guidelines. Among the shrine’s many wonders, there is a unique gate pillar that appears out of sync. This wasn’t a mistake — it was done on purpose, following the tradition of **Sakasabashira** - deliberate imperfection. The idea that seeking absolute perfection invites misfortune, while embracing imperfection ensures balance and protection. Time to be spent ~ 1 hour (Usually there is long queue for ticket purchase)
- Explore Futarasan shrine, Rinnoji Temple and Shinkyo Bridge. if you are tired then call it day. We visited Toshogu shrine and Shinkyo bridge only and skipped visiting futarasan shrine and Rinnoji temple.  
- Go back to hotel, have dinner, and relax

## Day 2: Kanmangafuchi Abyss and Kinugawa 
On Day 2, we will explore scenic beauty of Nikko, including some falls and Kinugawa onsen area. This covers off beat destinations and not densely populated with tourists. Kanmangafuchi Abyss is offbeat destination with beautiful view. 
- Start early morning to enjoy breathtaking view of Kanmangafuchi Abyss. Get bus from Tobu Nikko/JR Nikko station to Nishisando iriguchi bus stop. From this bus stop the destination is ~1 KM by walk. We took first bus at 6:05 and it was good decision. 
- This place is dedicated for Buddhist deities for peace and the sound of river makes up best music. It is a gem in early morning.  
- After spending some time, walk back to bus stop and Have breakfast (go back to hotel if staying nearby to Get ready before next destination).
- Catch train from Tobu Nikko station to Shimo imaichi, we took train at **09:52AM** from Tobu Nikko Station. From Shimo-imachi take Train bound for Shin Fujiwara station and get off at Kinugawa onsen. Now go for Kinutateiwaotsuri Bridge which is short walk away from Kinugawa onsen station. There is free footbath outside of Kinugawa Onsen station as well. Soak your feet if you want. 
- From Kinugawa onsen, take the train to Ryuokyo (Take Revaty Aizu Train). Although this train is Limited express & all seats are reserved but you can board it from Kinugawa station and Only Base fare is charged. 
- Ryuokyo station is beautiful amidst nature. From station Walk upto Nijimi Waterfall, the view is mesmerizing. If you want to spend more time there and hike, then go to Musasabi bridge but did not go there. 
- Go back to Ryuokyo station, purchase base fare ticket for Shin Fujiwara & take train back to shin Fujiwara. Change train from shin Fujiwara to Shimo imachi and then to Tobu Nikko.
- Call it a day, relax and go back to hotel. Have dinner and enjoy.  

## Day 3: Kirufuri Waterfall and Tobu World Square  
On last day, let’s keep the itinerary relaxed and spare some free time as well.  and Tobu world square is place where there are famous monuments across the globe. This has Europe section, America section, Asia Section and Japan section. 
- Take Bus from Tobu Nikko or JR Nikko station to Kirufuri Falls and get off at Kirufuri No Taki station. Walk upto Kirufuri Waterfall and enjoy nature. Time to be spent ~ 1 hour. You can take next bus bound from Tobu Nikko. Check the bus timetable. We covered it within 30 mins and took the bus back to station. We took first bus from JR nikko station and were back at station in 1.5 hours.
